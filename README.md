# Variational Autoencoder on MNIST Dataset
 
This repository contains codes to a project on using variational autoencoders on MNIST datset. Different loss functions are used. Also,  the 2-dimensional latent space and methods to manipulate it are discoverd completely. Finally, conditional variational autoencoder were used to see the difference with simple autoencoders.
